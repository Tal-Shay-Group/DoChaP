            <p>The Domain Change Predictor (DoChaP) is a webserver for visualization of the exon-domain relation in transcripts. DoChaP is integrating information of transcripts and domain data from the NCBI and UCSC databases into a single database.</p>
<p>The idea of DoChaP came up from searching an easy way of exploring the effect of alternative splicing on protein domains.</p>
<p>Alternative RNA splicing results in multiple transcripts of the same gene, possibly coding different protein isoforms that may differ in their protein domains. Although transcripts and domain information can be extracted from public databases, it requires integration from several sources, it is tedious and unfeasible for genome wide analysis, and DoChaP will do it for you. DoChaP facilitates the study of alternative splicing effects on domain structure, which can lead to testable hypotheses in the form of 'protein X loses domain Y in state Z'. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
